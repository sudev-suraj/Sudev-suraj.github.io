    <!-- About Me -->
    <section id="about">
      <h2> About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I am a Mechanical Engineering undergraduate at <strong>NSS College of Engineering, Palakkad</strong> 
        with a growing passion for programming, problem solving, and technology integration. 
        While pursuing my core engineering studies, I am expanding my skillset in <strong>C, C++, Python, 
        and Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly believe in blending engineering knowledge with coding skills, opening doors to domains 
        like automation, robotics, simulations, and IoT.
